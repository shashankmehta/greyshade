##Conditions 

The only condition to use this theme for your octopress blog is that you have to set a different highlight color than the ones mentioned [here](https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade/wiki/Sites-using-Greyshade). When you have chosen a highlight color, please add it to the [wiki](https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade/wiki/Sites-using-Greyshade) so that no one else uses it.

Highlight color: This color is used on a:hover, blockquotes etc. I'll be using it in more places so that blogs with different highlight colors look slightly different and maintain a bit of their uniqueness. 

##Install

Assuming you have installed the default theme, type the code below in terminal.

    $ git clone git@github.com:shashankmehta/greyshade.git .themes/greyshade
    $ echo "\$greyshade: color;" >> sass/custom/_colors.scss //Substitue 'color' with your highlight color
    $ rake "install[greyshade]"
    $ rake generate

For profile picture and description, just add the relevant details in `_config.yml`
